Memory Grid
----

A visual memory game to recall marked tiles on a grid

###Rules/Walk Through###

Cells are filled randomly in the grid, and are hidden after 3.5 seconds.

The player tests their memory by trying to click all the cells that were filled.

Cell clicks that match will change the cell's color to green, while non-matched clicks will change it to red.

Correct and incorrect clicks are tallied, and the game ends when the user has clicked the number of cells that were randomly filled.

###Objective###

Complete a perfect game by clicking all the originally filled cells with zero misses.
