Memory Grid
----

A visual game to test your memory.

##Rules/Walk Through##

Cells are filled randomly in the grid, and are hidden after 3.5 seconds.

The player will then test their memory by trying to click all the cells that were fille.

Cell clicks that are correct will change the cell's color to green, while incorrect clicks will change to red.

Correct and incorrect clicks are tallied, and the game ends when the user has clicked the number of cells that were randomly filled.

##Objective##

Complete a perfect game by clicking all the originally filled cells in as many chances.
