# Project Feedback

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. I love to see such an extensive commit history! That's super important, and will really be handy when you get into group work too. I would've liked to have seen more on the planning side.  So, an wireframe, user stories, etc. The readme should also include installation instructions.  It does not seem too important with this project, given that you only need to open the index.html file.  But, moving forward it's super important, as we start getting into package managers and things like that!

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Your project shows a great understanding of the concepts and materials we've covered so far! I love that you've taken a creative approach and created a game different from the original memory game. Next step would be to attack those things to add that you listed in the readme!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations**.  Please review my inline comments (prefixed with my initials - "JGZ") for suggestions to help improve code quality.  My biggest piece of feedback here is to make sure you're commenting some of the larger functions.  For others who might go in and check out your code (especially working in groups), commenting is so important. Other than that, the code is very clean, neatly indented, and passes the validators.  I left notes with a few questions in line.  As far as your question regarding using an object, i think that was a great way to approach this! I understand it can get a little confusing with the "self" and "this". My suggestion would be to console log those often to make sure you're targeting the right thing.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations** You're commit history shows you approached this in a great way! Taking it step by step, and then cleaning it up once you have something functional. It would be great to see some evidence of a branch trying to add in any extra features, such as a reset button, scoreboard, etc.
